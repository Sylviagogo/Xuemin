   <h1>What is the French New Wave?</h1>
   <p>French New Wave otherwise called as Nouvelle Vague is a film movement in France began in late 1950s. The wave was started by the critics in association with Cahiers de Cinema who later became filmmakers. Thought Nouvelle Vague is not a movement, it was visible that they challenged the ‘quality’ of French Cinema setting a postwar trend within the French film culture and film making.</p>
