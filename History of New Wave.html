    <p>Et Dieu... Crea La Femme (And God Created Woman) (1956) is often cited as the first New Wave feature film. Directed by a 28 year old writer-director named Roger Vadim, and starring his then wife, 22 year old former model and dancer, Brigitte Bardot, it celebrated beauty and youthful rebellion and proved that a low budget film made by a first time director could be a success both at home and abroad. Although now somewhat dated, at the time the film was an inspiration to young directors hoping to make their first film on their own terms.</p>

    <p>An even more inspiring figure was Jean-Pierre Melville, whose 1956 crime caper Bob Le Flambeur (Bob The Gambler) was a landmark in the French thriller genre. Shot on location on the streets of Paris and in the director’s own home made studio, its portrayal of the doomed gambler of the title, was both grittily realistic and audaciously stylized. The New Wave critics quickly recognised that Melville was the real deal: a maverick with an authentic cinematic vision all his own.</p>

    <p>The term New Wave first appeared in 1957 in an article in L’Express entitled “Report on Today’s Youth.” The article, by the journalist Francoise Giroud, and the book she published the following year called The New Wave: Portrait of Today’s Youth, had nothing to do with cinema, but was about the need for change in society. However, the term was borrowed by journalists who used it to apply to the young directors creating a storm at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, and soon the phrase caught on internationally.</p>

    <h2>1968 - Year of Revolution</h2>

    <p>In the spring of 1968, a minor protest by students at Nanterre University quickly escalated, leading to major civil unrest all over France. On May 10th in Paris there was a violent confrontation between student demonstrators and the police. Over the following days discontent with the Gaullist government spread into the labour force and workers began joining in the protest with a series of strikes and factory occupations. Ultimately, the De Gaulle government held firm, and, partly because of divisions within the leftist opposition, the protests died away.</p>
<h2>Then and Now: The New Wave Continues</h2>

<p>An enduring legacy of the French New Wave movement was the inspiration it provided for similar movements in other countries. In America, the “movie brat” generation of filmmakers that emerged in the late 1960’s and 70’s, was profoundly influenced by the storytelling techniques pioneered by the Novelle Vague directors. In Europe too, young directors in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Germany, and elsewhere, were motivated to break with the past and tell their own stories. Even further afield, in countries such as Japan, Brazil, and Canada, similar movements prospered for a while. </p>
