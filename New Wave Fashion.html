<h2>French Gangster Style: Tough Guys & Existential Assassins</h2>

<p>As tough as Cagney, as quixotic as Bogart, as cool as MacQueen, as steely as Marvin – through the years the French tough guy has proved himself a worthy match for his Hollywood counterparts. From Jean Gabin in Pépé le Moko (1937) to Lino Ventura in Classe tous risques (1960), Jean-Paul Belmondo in Breathless (1960) to Alain Delon in Le Samourai (1967), French cinema has had its share of hardboiled gangsters and existential loners who live by their own rules and to hell with the consequences.</p>
<p>For the French movie tough guy, his style is a reflection of his natural dominance and flair for creative risk-taking. French cinema of the 1950s is rife with examples. One look at Jacques Becker’s Touchez pas au Grisbi (1954), for example, and one can't help but be impressed by the immaculately cut Camps de Luca suits worn by battling rival gangsters Gabin and Ventura. Or think of Yves Montand in Le Salaire de la peur (The Wages of Fear, 1953), transporting explosive nitro-glycerine through the steamy South American jungle wearing a stylish white vest and jaunty neckerchief. These are men who would cut a dash no matter how perilous the circumstances.</p>

<h2>Anna Karina Style</h2>

<p>Anna Karina was named by Coco Chanel, so it's probably no surprise that she still remains in the fashion pantheon today. Although perhaps not as well-known as her French New Wave contemporaries, Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve, Anna Karina has nonetheless had a lasting impact on the fashion world, having created a fresh and very French girlish persona and style that still resonates with designers and tastemakers worldwide.</p>

<p>First a model, the Danish Anna first appeared on film in black and white in Jean-Luc Godard's Le Petit Soldat after being discovered by him in a soap commercial in 1959. Though her trademark bright colours had yet to appear, the French press was already excited by her screen presence and fresh, innocent style. The world took notice, however, after her technicolor turns in both Pierrot Le Fou and Made In USA, also directed by Jean-Luc Godard. After releasing several albums as a musical artist and ye-ye girl in France, Serge Gainsborough created a vibrant, color-saturated musical called "Anna!" in 1967, based on her look and personality.</p>

<p>Fashion and the French New Wave have long enjoyed a mutual, and creatively productive, infatuation. Later we’ll explore the specific styles and influences of different starlets, but first it’s important to understand that the Nouvelle Vague was not just about the films it produced – it was also deeply enmeshed in the 1960s' "explosion of youth". Undeniably, its original popularity was due in no small part to the new youth music and new youth fashion movements of the time which found in the early New Wave films a sympathetic and harmonizing voice. And, like blobs of paint on a painter’s palette, the actors and directors of the Nouvelle Vague also used the contemporary mood to colour their mis-en-scene and create new atmospheres that reflected the era’s growing feeling of freedom. </p>
<p>Today, the looks the French New Wave created still resonate, and many designers and brands are still capitalizing on the movement's timeless appeal. In fact, at least two modern fashion labels are named for films of the new wave: Band of Outsiders, Scott Sternberg's preppy/vintage/eccentric brand, and Alpha 60, the Australian boutique streetwear brand. And French New Wave-inspired clothing is still a perennially cool choice for catwalk collections across the world from high street to red carpet. </p>
